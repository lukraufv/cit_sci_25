Citizen science project, poster

This repository contains PDFs with further information on concepts explored in the poster "Marine heatwaves in the Archipelago Sea - coping mechanisms"

This poster follows the responses of Perry the Perch, Bladdy the Bladderwrack, Mya the Sand gaper, Russel the Bluemussel and Crabby the crab as they are faced with a marine heatwave. 
The poster is intended to in a simple way showcase different concepts (Marine heatwaves, Habitat forming species and Temperature performance curves) as well as different coping strategies (migration, microclimates and metabolic depression), as well as the impacts on species and communities after a severe heatwave.

Drawings are made by Lucinda Kraufvelin
