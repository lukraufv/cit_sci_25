This repository contains PDFs with further information on concepts explored in the poster "Marine heatwaves in the Archipelago Sea - coping mechanisms"

Marine heatwaves are intensifying in frequency and duration, posing significant challenges to coastal ecosystems. This educational poster is designed as an outreach tool. It presents a comic-strip narrative following five species often found in the Baltic Sea along the Archipelagos of Southwest Finland. We follow the responses of Perry the Perch, Bladdy the Bladderwrack, Mya the Sand gaper, Russell the Bluemussel and Crabby the crab  as they experience the physiological and ecological impacts of a marine heatwave event.
The comic introduces concepts and coping mechanisms such as thermal performance curves (TPCs), metabolic depression, microclimates, migration, and the importance of habitat-forming species. Each concept is linked to a QR code that leads to additional resources, including simplified scientific explanations and illustrations, making complex ecological phenomena accessible to a broader audience. It also highlights the importance of biodiversity and adaptive strategies in the face of increasingly extreme environmental conditions.
By combining science communication with visual storytelling, the poster promotes understanding of how marine ecosystems cope with climate change. It also encourages scientific discussion by showing how challenging it can be to simplify complex ecological processes, highlighting the trade-offs and choices involved in communicating science.
